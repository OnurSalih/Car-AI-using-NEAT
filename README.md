# Car-AI-with-NEAT
Basic self-driving AI car game using pygame

The idea was to make a game where a car can drive on a track. The game was created using the pygame library and the AI was created using the NEAT algorithm (reference: https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html) 

The idea was inspired by a youtuber who also made a similar project on a simpler track.
